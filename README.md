pyDataSci is a python library for data scientists working on exploratory data science problems. I sue it in my work to help speed up my workflow.

It is consistent with the sklearn API and can therefore drop directly into exiting workflows.

It contains functions to help with ensembling models, evaluating model performance and performing initial data wrangling.

# Installation

It will be pip installable in future iterations.
