pyDataSci is a python library for data scientists working on (binary) classification problems using tabluar data. It features convienence functions I find myself regularily re-using. 

It contains functions to assist the exploration of and the development of prototype predictive models. The library includes functions to:

- perform univariate feature analysis.
- train and evaluate models
