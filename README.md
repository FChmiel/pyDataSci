# datascipy

Functions useful to general data science activities, its primary motivation is to support my [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) entries and be an educational side project.


It includes functions to help when ensembling models, perform pseudo labelling and perform quick cross validation of sklearn classifiers.
