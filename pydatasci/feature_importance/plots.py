def continuous_distribution(df, feature, target):
	"""
	Plots a distribution for a continuous feature, stratified by the binary 
	target. A Kolomogorov-Smirnov two-sample test is performed to check if 
	the two samples are drawn from the same distribution.

	A small D, or high p means we cannot reject the Null hypothesis that the
	two distributions are drawn from the same distribution.

	Parameters:
	----------
	df, pd.DataFrame
		Pandas dataframe containing the data to plot.

	feature, str
		Name of column in df containing continuous variable to plot.

	target, {str, array-like}
		Name of the column containing the target or array containing the 
		target for each instance in df. The target must be binary.

	Returns:
	--------
	D, float
		The 2-sample KS statistic

	p, float 
		p-value for the 2-sample KS statistic. Tests the Null hypothesis that
		the two distributions are drawn from the same distribution.
	
	fig, matplotlib.figure.Figure
		Figure instance the distribution was plotted too.

	Plots a binary distribution where the y-axis is the mean target
